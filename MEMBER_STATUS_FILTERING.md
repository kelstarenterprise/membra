# Member Status Filtering Implementation

## Problem Solved
The dues assignment system was failing because it was looking for `ACTIVE` members only, but newly created members have `PROSPECT` status by default.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated MemberSearch Component
**File**: `src/components/shared/MemberSearch.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `status` field to Member type definition
- Added visual filtering logic to disable suspended members
- Suspended members appear in list but are:
  - Grayed out with disabled styling
  - Show status badge (SUSPENDED)
  - Show "Cannot assign dues" message
  - Cannot be clicked or selected
  - Checkbox is disabled for suspended members

**Active Statuses**: `PROSPECT`, `PENDING`, `ACTIVE`
**Inactive Status**: `SUSPENDED`

### 2. Updated Dues Assignment API
**File**: `src/app/api/subscriptions/assessments/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Updated individual member selection to include active statuses
- Updated category-based member selection to include active statuses
- Both now use: `status: { in: ['PROSPECT', 'PENDING', 'ACTIVE'] }`

### 3. Member Status Hierarchy

```
PROSPECT  ✅ Can be assigned dues (default for new members)
PENDING   ✅ Can be assigned dues  
ACTIVE    ✅ Can be assigned dues
SUSPENDED ❌ Cannot be assigned dues (appears disabled in UI)
```

### 4. User Experience

**In Member Search Dropdown**:
- Active members: Normal display, clickable, selectable
- Suspended members: 
  - Grayed out appearance
  - Red status badge
  - Warning icon (⚠)
  - "Cannot assign dues" text
  - Not clickable/selectable

**In Dues Assignment**:
- Only active members will be processed
- Suspended members are excluded from dues assignment
- Clear error messages if no active members found

### 5. Database Test Data

Created test members with different statuses:
- Edward WIlson: ACTIVE
- Debug Test: ACTIVE  
- Suspended Member: SUSPENDED

### 6. API Behavior

**Members API** (`/api/members`):
- Returns all members regardless of status (for admin management)
- Includes status field in response

**Dues Assignment API** (`/api/subscriptions/assessments`):
- Only processes active members
- Excludes suspended members from dues assignment
- Returns proper error if no active members found

## Benefits

1. **Consistent UX**: Users can see all members but understand why some can't be selected
2. **Data Integrity**: Prevents dues assignment to suspended members
3. **Clear Feedback**: Visual indicators show member status and restrictions
4. **Flexible API**: Member API serves different purposes while maintaining filtering at UI level
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add more statuses or modify filtering rules

## Testing

✅ Member creation works (defaults to PROSPECT status)
✅ Dues assignment works for PROSPECT members
✅ Suspended members appear but cannot be selected
✅ Category-based assignment includes active members only
✅ Individual selection includes active members only
